### Target sites
# .Site is either a T0 disk, T1 disk, or a T2
# .Site must be in READY state (as given in Site Status Board http://dashb-ssb.cern.ch/dashboard/request.py)
# .Site must not be in IGNORE activation status (DDM-internal flag)
On site.name in T0_CERN_CH_Disk T1_*_Disk T2_* and site.status == READY and site.active != IGNORE

### Deletion trigger and strategy
When site.occupancy > 0.5 until site.occupancy < 0.45

### Replica protection / deletion policies
# Each dataset replica (parts subscribed to DataOps) is passed through the following policies.
# The first matching line determines the fate of the replica:
#  If a Protect line matches, the replica is protected.
#  If a Delete line matches, the replica is considered as a deletion candidate.
# If the site needs deletion, replicas in the deletion candidate list are deleted in the order
# specified by the strategy definition at the bottom.

# Requested by ??? on ???; validity ???

# Do not delete if any part of the replica is locked
Protect if replica.has_locked_block

# Delete replicas of deprecated datasets
Delete if dataset.status == DEPRECATED

# Do not delete if replica is incomplete (not all subscribed data is copied to the site)
Protect if replica.incomplete

# Do not delete if a tape subscription is made but is not fulfilled
Protect if dataset.on_tape == PARTIAL

# If nothing matches, the replica is a deletion candidate
Delete

### Deletion strategy
# A removal of a replica at one site can make another replica elsewhere a last copy.
# Static deletion removes as many replicas as needed from the sites at once.
# Replicas of least-popular datasets are deleted first.
Strategy static order by dataset.usage_rank
