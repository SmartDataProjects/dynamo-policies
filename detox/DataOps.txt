# Each dataset replica (parts subscribed to DataOps) is passed through the following policies.
# The first matching line determines the fate of the replica:
#  If a Protect line matches, the replica is protected.
#  If a Delete line matches, the replica is considered as a deletion candidate.
# If a site requires deletion (is filled up to more than 90%), replicas in the deletion candidate list
# are deleted in the order of increasing popularity (i.e. the least popular replica goes first).
