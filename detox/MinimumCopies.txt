# Generic policy stack protecting minimum copies
# Each dataset replica (parts subscribed to DataOps) is passed through the following policies.
# The first matching line determines the fate of the replica:
#  If a Protect line matches, the replica is protected.
#  If a Delete line matches, the replica is considered as a deletion candidate.
# If a site requires deletion (is filled up to more than 90%), replicas in the deletion candidate list
# are deleted in the order of increasing popularity (i.e. the least popular replica goes first).

# Do not delete from sites not in READY state (as given in Site Status Board http://dashb-ssb.cern.ch/dashboard/request.py)
Protect if site.status != READY

# Do not delete from sites in IGNORE status (set by DDM team by hand)
Protect if site.active == IGNORE

# Delete replicas of deprecated datasets
Delete if dataset.status == DEPRECATED

# Do not delete if replica is incomplete (not all subscribed data is copied to the site)
Protect if replica.incomplete

# Do not delete non-RECO datasets that are not fully on tape
Protect if dataset.on_tape != FULL and dataset.name != /*/*/RECO

# Decided by CompOps on Aug 5, 2016
# Delete big transient replicas N days after the dataset is closed
Delete if dataset.name == /*/*/RAW and dataset.last_update < 60 days ago
Delete if dataset.name == /*/*LogError*/RAW-RECO and dataset.last_update < 90 days ago
Delete if dataset.name == /*/*/RECO and dataset.last_update < 90 days ago

# Delete unpopular replicas
# Usage rank is the average of
#  (days since last CRAB access) - (# accesses) - (size in TB)
# across all sites that host copies of the dataset. Popular datasets have lower ranking values.
# If no access has been recorded for a replica, days since completion of the transfer of the last block is used.
Delete if dataset.usage_rank > 400

# Old unpopular datasets can still stay in the system if we keep bouncing its copies between sites.
# If a dataset is old but was copied recently, either some user actually wanted to analyze it or DDM
# copied it to offload some site. In the former case, we would assume the user wouldn't leave it sitting
# for more than 30 days.
Delete if dataset.last_update < 600 days ago and replica.last_block_created < 30 days ago and replica.num_access == 0

# Protect if this is one of the last copies
Protect if dataset.has_no_extra_copies

# If nothing matches, the replica is a deletion candidate
Delete
