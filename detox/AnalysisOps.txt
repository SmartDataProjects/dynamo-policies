### Target sites
# .Site is either a T1 disk or a T2
# .Site must be in READY state (as given in Site Status Board http://dashb-ssb.cern.ch/dashboard/request.py)
# .Site must not be in IGNORE activation status (DDM-internal flag)
On site.name in [T1_*_Disk T2_*] and site.status == READY and site.active != IGNORE

### Deletion trigger
When site.occupancy > 0.9
Until site.occupancy < 0.85

### Replica protection / deletion policies
# Each dataset replica (parts subscribed to AnalysisOps) is passed through the following policies.
# The first matching line determines the fate of the replica:
#  If a Protect line matches, the replica is protected.
#  If a Delete line matches, the replica is considered as a deletion candidate.
# If the site needs deletion, replicas in the deletion candidate list are deleted in the order
# specified by the strategy definition at the bottom.

# Requested by ??? on ???; validity ???

# Delete unpopular replicas
# Usage rank is the average of
#  (days since last CRAB access) - (# accesses) - (size in TB)
# across all sites that host copies of the dataset. Popular datasets have lower ranking values.
# If no access has been recorded for a replica, days since completion of the transfer of the last block is used.
Delete dataset.usage_rank > 400

# Old unpopular datasets can still stay in the system if we keep bouncing its copies between sites.
# If a dataset is old but was copied recently, either some user actually wanted to analyze it or DDM
# copied it to offload some site. In the former case, we would assume the user wouldn't leave it sitting
# for more than 30 days.
Delete dataset.last_update < 600 days ago and replica.last_block_created < 30 days ago and replica.num_access == 0

# Protect if this is one of the last copies
Protect dataset.name == '/*/*/MINIAOD*' and dataset.num_full_disk_copy < 3
Protect dataset.num_full_disk_copy < 2

# If nothing matches, the replica is a deletion candidate
Delete

### Deletion strategy
# A removal of a replica at one site can make another replica elsewhere a last copy.
# Iterative deletion re-evaluates the protection decisions after each deletion of a replica.
# Replicas of least-popular datasets are deleted first.
Strategy iterative order by dataset.usage_rank
